But I think to become a good pentester you should know how things work. Pentesting is a very wide field, like if you are interested in webapp pentesting then you should know how application interacts with databases, basics of databses, webapp languages. Similarly if you want to become system/platform(OS) pentester, you should know how to setup the OS, how to do system configuration, and what people can miss when they do configuration. This can guide you to think in the direction of finding vulnerability. If you want to go into network pentesting, you should know TC/IP layer, OSI layer, network configuration and basic knowledge of how internet and firewall works. Always remember, information security is a journey, there are emough amount of things to learn and they keep increasing as the technology changes, so only thing that you need to conquer this journey is patience and curiosity. When I started OSCP, I didn't even know about nmap, so it is not that before attempting OSCP you have to learn something. Only prerequisite is: - Basic understanding of OS, and TCP/IP protocol - Also, it would be great if you are familiar with basic commands in linux and windows. - Able to read and understand code written in C, python and bash First phase of pentesting is the \"Information Gathering\" phase, in this the pentester searches for publicly available information about the client and identifies potential ways to connect to its systems. After this, the tester uses this information to determine the value of each finding and the impact to the client if the finding permitted an attacker to break into a system. Second phase is \"Vulnerability Analysis\", this is the phase where you attempt to discover vulnerability in the system, system can be a webapp, any application running on particular OS or the OS itself. Once you find that there is a vulnerability, then you need to find a way to exploit it. Next comes \"Exploitation Phase\" depends on the type/kind of vulnerability and a pentester need to craft a exploit using his/her skill to exploit the software. Fourth phase is \"Post-Exploitation\" phase, where the result of the exploitation is used to find additional information, sensitive data(like password files, password stored in browser, other private files ), access to other systems resources. Then comes the last phase called \"Reporting\" phase, in this, the pentester summarizes the findings, including steps of exploitation and problem with the software which allows attacker to exploit it. I am covering all these phases including some other resource that will help you in OSCP as well as pentesting journey.

There are many linux flavour available in market, like Ubuntu, RedHat, OpenSuse but Kali is one of the best for people in infosec as it contains all the tools preinstalled which are required by any pentester. It is always better to install Kali as a guest OS/virtual OS, on top of existing OS like windows, reason is, since kali OS is going to be the source of all attacks what you are going to do against other target(other PCs/Websites), even if your own system got hacked by unethical people it will only effect the vmware OS only, not the original OS on top of which you are running your kali. So, before installing Kali OS, you need to install hypervisor software, there are 2 well supported hypervisor available in market, VMWare and VirtualBox. I personally like working with Vmware, so download and install Vmware from this link - https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html Once Vmware got installed, download zip file of kali linux from this link - https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/ or if you applied for OSCP, you will get a download link of kali from OSCP in a mail. Only difference between these 2 kali version is that the OSCP kali linux contains some extra preinstalled tools which might be needed during OSCP. Unzip above file using 7z software, you can download 7z from here, if you don't have it already: https://www.7-zip.org/download.html Go to the extracted folder and open file having type as Vmware virtual machine configuration(Kali-Linux-2019.1-vm-amd64). Once it get opened it will show prompt like below: Click on \"I Copied It\". Once it boots, type Username: root and Passwords: toor There might be chances that you need to change the network adapter settings. VMware offers 3 options for virtual network connections: bridged, NAT, and host only. You should choose the bridged option, but below is the info on each: - Bridged network: It connects the virtual machine directly to the local network using the same connection as the host system. As far as the local network is concerned, our virtual machine is just another node on the network with its own IP address. - NAT(Network Address Translation): It sets up a private network on the host machine. The private network translates outgoing traffic from the virtual machine to the local network. On the local network, traffic from the virtual machine will appear to come from the host machine\u2019s IP address. - Host-only network: It limits the virtual machine to a local private network on the host. The virtual machine will be able to communicate with other virtual machines in the host-only network as well as the host machine itself, but it will not be able to send or receive any traffic with the local network or the Internet. Chose Bridge Network Connection: ''' Go to player- Machine - Virtual Machine Settings - Bridged option.
